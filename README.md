# files
tidyup.R - This file reads in the data set and replaces the numerical levels with their correspond labels so that they are easier to analyze. Note that this file might make some changes that loses information. It also adds additional features that are engineered from the data.

interesting_plot.Rmd - An R markdown file that creates a bunch of plots, some basic statistical tests, and data summaries. It is mostly sandbox, used to test ideas and techniques. It uses markdown to easily comb through many plots at once, but is not quie meant for generating a final report.
