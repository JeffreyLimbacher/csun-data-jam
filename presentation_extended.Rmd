## CSUN Datajam Competition

- Submission in the fist datajam competition held at CSUN.

- Data set: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), Wave I.
    - Survey done in 1994-95.

- A sample set of variables was released on September 29th.

- The full set of variables was released on October 27th.

- Submission deadline was November 1st, at 9 PM.

- Presentations were given on November 3rd.

- My team, the Infinite Limits won "Best Reproducible Research". 

## Data Format

- The data was given in the form of a csv with numbers, and a data dictionary that defined the labels for those numbers ($n$=6504, $p$=123).

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/csv_unprocessed.png")
```
```{r out.width="100%", fig.cap="Top: unprocessed csv file. Bottom: data dictionary."}
include_graphics("images/data_dict.png")
```

## Problems

- The data was difficult to read with just the numbers.
    - Slower data exploration

- Missing values were given integer values which were unique to each column.
    - Removing them required analyzing each column separately.

- Multiple values could correspond to a missing value. 

## Data Cleaning

- I created a script that used the data dictionary to label the dataset in R.

```{r out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/csv_processed.png")
```

- This allowed for faster data visualization. 

- Both graphs below were produced with the same call.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=2, out.width="40%"}

unlab %>%
  mutate(BIO_SEX=factor(BIO_SEX)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=BIO_SEX,y=CGPATOTW1))

health %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=BIO_SEX,y=CGPATOTW1))

```

## Teen Depression

- A study published in *Pediatrics* showed that from 2005 to 2014, the number of teenage major depressive episodes increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.5 % in 2014. \footnote{Ramin Mojtabai, Mark Olfson, Beth Han, "National Trends in the Prevalence and Treatment of Depression in Adolescents and Young Adults"}

- NPR reports that mental health problems can manifest as  chronic absence, low achievement, disruptive behavior and dropping out. \footnote{Anderson, "Mental Health In Schools: A Hidden Crisis Affecting Millions Of Students"}

- The NPR story follows a student who was diagnosed with depression and bulimia.

- "I felt like nobody wanted to help me".

- What are indicators of depression?

## Analyzing Depression within the ADD health set

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
p1 <- health %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=DEPREW1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  geom_point(aes(x=DEPREW1,y=0)) +
  labs(x="Depression Wave") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Depression")

health2 <- health %>%
  filter(!is.na(DEPREW1) & DEPREW1 > 0) %>%
  mutate(DEPREW1=log(DEPREW1))

p2 <- health2 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_qq(aes(sample=DEPREW1)) +
  ggtitle("QQ-Normal Plot vs log(Depression)")

multiplot(p1,p2, cols = 1)
```

## Approach: Multivariable Regression

- My team chose to analyze the relationship between depression and the other variables in the data set.

- The linearity in the QQ-plot in $\log(\mathrm{Depression})$ was encouraging.

- As a team of applied math students, we had a good background in the theory behind multivariable regression.

- Most statistical methods we learned were for smaller $n$ and $p$.

## Preparation for Regression

- The data contained many missing values.
    - Every row had an NA in at least one column.
    
- In order to use R's `lm` function, we narrow down the subset of variables based on the number of `NA` values.
    - I did not choose to do KNN imputation because our $p$ was large.
    - Unfamiliar with other forms of 

- `step` was called to select the best predictors.

```{r fig.height=4}
health %>%
  summarise_all(function(x) sum(is.na(x))) %>%
  gather() %>%
  arrange(desc(value)) %>%
  filter(value > 2000) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(key,value),y=value),stat="identity") +
  xlab("Column Name") +
  ylab("Number of Missing Values") +
  coord_flip()
```

## Analysis of Linear Model

- Our model had an $R^2$ of .46 which indicates that there are more unexplained variables.
- We didn't incorporate interaction terms.
- There were many observations with missing values which were excluded (6504 $\rightarrow$ 1621).
- Our submission to the data jam chose linear model for a variety of reasons, but can we do better?

## After Datajam: Trying more models

- After Datajam, tried more methods using the `PerformanceEstimation` library.

- Compared the final Datajam linear model, 3 decision trees, and a random forest using $NMSE$ as the metric.
  - $5$-fold cross validation repeated 5 times.
  
- A Wilcoxon-signed rank test comparing the rankings of the various runs of the model came out highly statistical significant, ($p < 1e-7$)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4, fight.width = 4}

load("./workflow_comp")

plot(res)
```

## Table of NMSE values from Performance Estimation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ressum <- summary(res)
res.tab<- tibble(stat=rownames(ressum$DEPREW1$lm),
                 lm.nmse=ressum$DEPREW1$lm[,],
                 rpart.v1.nmse=ressum$DEPREW1$rpartXse.v1[,],
                 rpart.v2.nmse=ressum$DEPREW1$rpartXse.v2[,],
                 rpart.v3.nmse=ressum$DEPREW1$rpartXse.v3[,],
                 randomForest.nmse=ressum$DEPREW1$randomForest[,])
```
```{r}
kable(res.tab[-7,],digits=3)
```

## Looking at Most Important Variables from Random Forest

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
rf_mod <- randomForest(depmod_both$call$formula, data=health_rmna)
importance(rf_mod,type=1)
```
